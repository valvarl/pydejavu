Audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in Python

See the explanation here:

`http://willdrevo.com/fingerprinting-and-audio-recognition-with-python/`__

Dejavu can memorize recorded audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting
it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input or on disk file,
Dejavu attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the
database, returning the song or recording being played.
